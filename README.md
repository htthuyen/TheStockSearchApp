## Overview

### Description

The Stock Search App allows users to search for a stock by its ticker symbol and instantly view real-time market data, including company name, price, exchange, and currency

### App Evaluation
   - **Category:** Finance
   - **Mobile:** Provides fast, on-the-go access to real-time stock data. The app is designed for mobile-first interactions — optimized for quick lookup with minimal input. Potential to integrate notifications for price alerts or voice input for ticker search to enhance mobile-native features.
   - **Story:** Empowers individual investors and casual market watchers with a simple tool to stay informed about stock performance anytime, anywhere. Especially useful for people who follow multiple tickers but don’t want the complexity of a full trading app.
   - **Market:** The app targets a wide base of users — from beginner investors and finance students to hobbyists and traders who want a lightweight solution. 
   - **Habit:** Users are likely to open the app daily or even multiple times a day during market hours to track favorite stocks. While primarily a consumption-based app, it could become more engaging by allowing users to build and follow a watchlist.
   - **Scope:** Technically feasible to build within a short timeframe using a stock API like API Ninjas. A basic MVP (search + display stock info) is simple yet valuable. The product scope is clearly defined and can be expanded after MVP (e.g., add favorites, charts, price alerts, or earnings calendar).
