## New App Ideas - Evaluate and Categorize
1. Stock Search App
   - **Description**: Allows users to search for a stock by its ticker symbol and instantly view real-time market data, including company name, price, volume,low, high, etc.
   - **Category:** Finance
   - **Mobile:** Provides fast, on-the-go access to real-time stock data. The app is designed for mobile-first interactions — optimized for quick lookup with minimal input. Potential to integrate notifications for price alerts or voice input for ticker search to enhance mobile-native features.
   - **Story:** Empowers individual investors and casual market watchers with a simple tool to stay informed about stock performance anytime, anywhere. Especially useful for people who follow multiple tickers but don’t want the complexity of a full trading app.
   - **Market:** The app targets a wide base of users — from beginner investors and finance students to hobbyists and traders who want a lightweight solution. 
   - **Habit:** Users are likely to open the app daily or even multiple times a day during market hours to track favorite stocks. While primarily a consumption-based app, it could become more engaging by allowing users to build and follow a watchlist.
   - **Scope:** Technically feasible to build within a short timeframe using a stock API like API Ninjas. A basic MVP (search + display stock info) is simple yet valuable. The product scope is clearly defined and can be expanded after MVP (e.g., add favorites, charts, price alerts, or earnings calendar).

1. Cat Breed Info App
   - **Description**: Allow users enter a cat breet name and view details such as lifespan, diet, personality traits, and more.
   - **Category:** Animals
   - **Mobile:** Designed for a quick lookups on the go or even at a pet store or animal shelter. Could leverage mobile-specific features like voice-input for hands-free search, offline mode for access in-low connectivity areas, and camera to identify breeds using image recognition in future versions
   - **Story:** Offers an accessible and informative way for cat lovers, new pet owners, or adopters to learn about various breeds. 
   - **Market:** The potential audiences are cat owners, pet adopters, breeders, and animal shelter volunteers. 
   - **Habit:** Users use the app when adopting or reasearching a new cat, or when trying to understand breed-specific behaviors 
   - **Scope:** MVP is clearly defined and simple to build, including input field for breed name and fetch and display breed info via API
